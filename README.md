UTILS
-------
utilities that I wrote; could be helpful.

- [flatten.sh](https://github.com/anubhab-mandal/utils/blob/main/flatten.sh) - flattens PDFs and downsamples the images in them if asked to. [good opsec? or whatever, just got time to kill.]
- [hexcomp.sh](https://github.com/anubhab-mandal/utils/blob/main/hexcomp.sh) - compare hexes of two files. [i have no idea why i wrote that.]
- [rename.sh](https://github.com/anubhab-mandal/utils/blob/main/rename.sh) - mass rename files in a directory [why not]
- [todoprog.cpp](https://github.com/anubhab-mandal/utils/blob/main/todoprog.cpp) - takes in .txt input, or normal input, generates list, and a progress bar down below. [i love this one. im proud of this one lol.]
- more to come as i write them
